# Datamining
This project is related to the course  Data-mining for networks of my Master 2 Ubinet. I have tried to implement one algorithm to differentiate between the normal and malicious users of a website. Each user is defined by his IP address and I tried to modelise the behavior of this user by using one graph that summarizes all the flows generated by the user to see if there is a malicious flow associated to his address IP. After defining the kernel function to differenciate between the malicious and the correct users I have used the SVM technique as the classifier that takes the kernel defined before as argument. At the end, I have trained my model and then I evaluate it by using the cross validation to see really the degree of differenciation of users that my model can perform.
